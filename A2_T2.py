# A2_T2: Escape sequence and print parameters
# Make a Python program, which prompts user for a car brand and model. After user inputs, do print the car brand and model sentence with two print commands using “sep” and “end” parameters.

# Example program run:

# Program starting.
# Insert car brand: Toyota
# Insert car model: Corolla
# Car brand is "Toyota" and the model is 'Corolla'.
# Program ending.


print("Program starting.")
brand = input("Insert car brand: ")
model = input("Insert car model: ")
print(f"Car brand is \"{brand}\" and the model is '{model}'")
print("Program ending.")
