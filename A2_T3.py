# A2_T3: String length and concatenation
# Make Python program, which prompts user to insert two words. Print the length of each word and then compound them together. Put single quotes around the compound word.

# Example program run:

# Program starting.
# Insert first word: fire
# Insert second word: fighter
# 1st word is 4 characters long.
# 2nd word is 7 characters long.
# Words together makes one closed compound 'firefighter'.
# Program ending.


print("Program starting.")
word1 = input("Insert first word: ")
word2 = input("Insert second word: ")
print(f"1st word is {len(word1)} characters long.")
print(f"2nd word is {len(word2)} characters long.")
print(f"Words together makes one closed compound '{word1 + word2}'.")
print("Program ending.")
